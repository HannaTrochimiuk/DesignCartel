    "aboutText": "Design Cartel is a group of people who love interiors and good design. We have been focusing on commercial interiors for several years. We work with investors, architects and/or designers and together we select and adjust elements, materials and solutions for the project. We are all truly open and, what is not very common, we appreciate and are simply fond of people. Work on the project has to be effective and efficient, but in a fair and positive atmosphere full of understanding and attention. And this is what we give from the beginning to each of our clients. A guarantee of honesty and professionalism with a smile on the face. You are more than welcome to reach out and work with us.",
    "valueHuman":"Human in the center of our desig",
    "valueTextHuman":"Each project has its origin in Human. We design for her/him and with her/him in mind. Office spaces are places of work, but also rest, meetings or conversations. There are places that require a lot of employee focus, there are also those whose role is to charge the batteries with positive energy. At the basis of each of our projects lies the question about the user of a given space. Who is s/he? How old is s/he? What is the nature of work? What is her/his role in the company? We collect this kind of information and provide it in the form of a project for walls, glazing and signage. We personalize the interior.",

    "valueTextDesign":"First of all: a good project is key! We are lucky, because our clients truly like and appreciate good design. As a result, graphic designers have a lot of work to do.

Furthermore, we care about the high quality of materials we use to make our products more durable, this is why we give a 5-year warranty on most of them.

    "servicesWayfinding": "wayfinding",
    "servicesTextWayfinding":"In other words, it is a spatial orientation system. It is used in almost every commercial space. A hotel is a good example here.

It is extremely important that the materials used are adapted to the interior design, durable and practical in the selected space.",
